How-To:

1) Put the pade.py file in the folder where you want to perform
the analytical coontinuation and change the settings in the Python script according to your setup:

norb: number of orbitals
nw: Number of imaginary Matsubara frequencies
nw_out: How many frequencies do you want on the real axis?
emin, emax: The frequency range on the real axis
g_loc.dat: The filename of your Matsubara Green's function 

Then run "python pade.py"

The ouput pade.dat contains the Green's function on the real axis,
the first column is frequency, the second is real part for first orbital,
the third is imaginay part for first orbital,
the fourth is real part of second orbital, etc....

So if you want to plot the spectral function, you can use in gnuplot:
p 'pade.dat' u 1:(-$3/pi) w l
